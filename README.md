# Flight Analysis Visualizations

This repository contains a series of visualizations representing various aspects of flight analysis, particularly focusing on factors leading to aviation accidents. Below are the descriptions and visuals for each aspect analyzed. This data has been extracted and analyzed with the Aviation Investigation Preliminary Report (ERA24FA058).

## 1. Side View of the Uncontrolled Descent
This visual shows the steep descent angle of the aircraft, from its initial altitude to the point of impact.

## 2. Simulated Debris Field
The dark red dots indicate the scattered pieces of debris, spread in a fan-like pattern from the point of impact. The black dot marks the impact point of the crash.
