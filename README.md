# Flight Analysis Visualizations

This repository contains a series of visualizations representing various aspects of flight analysis, particularly focusing on factors leading to aviation accidents. Below are the descriptions and visuals for each aspect analyzed. This data has been extracted and analyzed with the Aviation Investigation Preliminary Report (ERA24FA058).

## 1. Side View of the Uncontrolled Descent
This visual shows the steep descent angle of the aircraft, from its initial altitude to the point of impact.

## 2. Simulated Debris Field
The dark red dots indicate the scattered pieces of debris, spread in a fan-like pattern from the point of impact. The black dot marks the impact point of the crash.

## 3. Simulated Altitude-Based Flight Path with Oscillations
This graph depicts the fluctuating altitude pattern of the aircraft over time, culminating in a sharp descent.

## 4. Common Fatal Mistakes Made by Pilot Ranked by Severity
This bar chart ranks the most fatal mistakes made by the pilot in question, according to their severity.

### Pilot Disorientation and Confusion: 
Illustrated by a confused pilot figure or a symbol representing confusion, indicating the pilot's potential lack of situational awareness or misunderstanding of the aircraft's position and condition.

### Inappropriate Passenger Interference:
Depicted by a symbol showing a passenger interacting with aircraft controls, representing the dangerous involvement of an untrained individual in flight operations.

### Neglect of Standard Operating Procedures: 
Symbolized by a broken checklist or a cross over standard flight instruments, highlighting the disregard for established flight safety protocols.

### Failure to Respond to Air Traffic Control (ATC) Instructions: \
Represented by a symbol showing ignored or missed communication attempts from ATC, such as a radio with a cross over it.

### Erratic Flight Path with Altitude Oscillations: 
Illustrated by a line graph or a simplified flight path showing significant ups and downs, representing the unstable and fluctuating altitude during the flight.

### Rapid and Uncontrolled Descent Leading to Crash:
Depicted by a steep downward arrow or a graph line, symbolizing the final rapid descent and crash.
