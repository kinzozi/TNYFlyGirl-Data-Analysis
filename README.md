# Flight Analysis Visualizations

This repository contains a series of visualizations representing various aspects of flight analysis, particularly focusing on factors leading to aviation accidents. Below are the descriptions and visuals for each aspect analyzed.

## 1. Side View of the Uncontrolled Descent
This visual shows the steep descent angle of the aircraft, from its initial altitude to the point of impact.
